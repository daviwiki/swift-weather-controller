## Requirements

iOs 10

## Installation and Usage

At first you must install the Pods (If you haven't got Pod install in your machine please follow the instructions include [here](https://cocoapods.org/))

In a console execute:
1. git clone https://github.com/daviwiki/swift-weather-controller.git
2. cd swift-weather-controller/Weather
3. pod install
4. open Weather.xcworkspace

After that execute "cmd+R" to run the project.

## Developer notes

* The datas are hardcoded into WeatherPresenter. If you want to connect to real service implements the connection and parser from this layer (use of separated domain layer is recommended).
* To avoid the lagging when user scroll the tableview we replace the following lines of code into the class SVGView of Macaw library:
```swift
@IBInspectable open var fileName: String? {
        didSet {
            parseSVG()
            render()
        }
    }
```
with these new ones:
```swift
@IBInspectable open var fileName: String? {
        didSet {
            DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background).async {
                self.parseSVG()
                DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    self.render()
                }
            }
        }
    }
```
This code implements the parse of the svg into a secondary thread to improve UI performance
